## Projects

### [üî• Firefighter Sim](https://github.com/bradleyJT-CS/sim-firefighter)  
A simulation-style strategy game built in **Unreal Engine 5** where players manage wildfire suppression. My work focuses on **Blueprint scripting**, **Niagara VFX**, and the **fire/environment system**.  
*Note: Managed via Perforce‚Äîthis repo includes design notes and media instead of source code.*
